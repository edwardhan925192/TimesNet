# TimesNet 
![Overall purpose](https://github.com/edwardhan925192/Project3/assets/127165920/d1fb6548-e819-4ece-ba9e-e3922bba8c3e)  
The model meticulously employs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to ascertain the predominant frequencies, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns. To further enhance this process, the model has incorporated the sophisticated Inception block for feature extraction. This advanced mechanism ensures a comprehensive capture of both interperiod and intraperiod variations of fluctuations. By doing so, the model promises a holistic and nuanced understanding of the data, transcending traditional analytical methodologies.
